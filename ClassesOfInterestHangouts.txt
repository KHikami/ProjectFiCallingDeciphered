BOOKMARK FILES: (files that we ought to pay more attention to)
TeleWifiCallingSettingsService.java =
  -> calls glk
  -> calls ggt
glk.java = some sort of logger for the hangouts services
  -> calls gwb
  -> calls inx for telephony
ggt.java = new type of Binder
  -> added extention of ggs
  -> has a switch statement based on "wi.java" values
  -> has a specific case on 1598968902... (not the default case)
  -> calls gwb.T() with Context being fed in
  -> when Tyco Account involved, calls ggc
  -> calls glk for logging
gwb.java = seems to be the interface drawer
  -> returns a mup.java for telephony ops
  -> has a switch statement for call errors etc.
  -> seems to be the drawer for all the interfaces including that of calling (is the visual screen to all of the apps)
  -> calls gcq for answer/reject calls
  -> contains all of the loggings for LTE, 3G, WiFi, etc. calling :o
       -> uses context, gec, gcm, gfv to determine this
       -> also has a new gfo object which has methods to retrieve info...
       -> uses static methods in gcm, gfv
       -> might be where the threshold is determined! (method public static gfo a(Context context, gec gec, int i))
  -> ggq used to determine home & visitor call network?
gcq.java = A more complicated Connection? (Is this the caller sound of dialing etc.?) Caller Status Connection
  -> extends the connection class
  -> uses a gef to determine an address???
  -> uses gcc to set call
  -> uses gdc to handoff call
  -> plays tones??? (DTM tone)
  -> has state changes of the status of the calls
gec.java = reports the current network carrier for phone
  -> carrier identifier? (has a switch statement for roaming or T-mobile)
  -> has string babel_hutch
gcm.java = seems to be the cell state???
  -> initialized with signal state, service state, and more...
gfv.java
gfo.java
ggq.java
nyu.java
gcc.java
gdc.java

New Types & Objects:
kae.java = a new type that creates an object from a string or returns just the string.
itz.java = new object
wi.java = a place where a lot of constants are. (all of them regarding ints) uses constants from gwb and very specific arrays
nyt.java = 
nzf.java = seems to ba a large cache array?
nyx.java = extends nzf (seems to be a field logger?)
mup.java = a constant class that extends nyx (question mark class???)
  -> uses the super constructor of nyx
  -> has a method that returns a nzf and takes in a nyt
  -> uses static methods from nyu
gef.java
