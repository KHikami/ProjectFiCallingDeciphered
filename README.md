repo for class project Deciphering Project Fi Calling

Analysis done in a separate google drive doc (along with the logs etc.)
Contains Talk APK and Dialer APK we were using
Decompiled Talk APK and Dialer APK using JADX

TalkJADXDecompile contains the original decompiled code we were using. Contains comments for most of our analysis

TalkJADXDecompilev2-rec-prefs is the Talk APK re-decompiled using suggestions from our mentor again (Some files in original decompile did not decompile successfully or were missing)

TalkJADXDecompilev2 is the Talk APK re-decompiled using different settings.

DialerJADXDecompile was not used/needed as far as we could see in our search...

Log_scripts contains original python code meant to parse the logs using a dictionary. Ended up not being used.
